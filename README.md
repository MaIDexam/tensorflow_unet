This post is about a neural network and a very strange story connected with it. This project was created just for fun. I was 14 years old. Then I knew that it is a great project. I was offered to present it at the “Big Challenges” competition. This project scored the most points in the second stage of this competition. Then I presented it as a final project at the Kalashnikov Academy. I presented it twice. The first time just among data scientists. The second time among the best projects. My last presentation of this project was on December 18, 2024. It was my individual project at 10 grade. WHO KNEW THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD MAKE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON PEOPLE.When I created this project, I thought it was just crap
